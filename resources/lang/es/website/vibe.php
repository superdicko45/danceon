        Vibe is subjective and elusive term; we get that. That\'s why we\'ve come up with four vibe definitions that, in our opinion, most socials can be classified into – Party, PracticePLUS, Outdoor, and Tango.

        These categories are general and don\'t mean to be all encompassing. We\'re aware that there may be socials that don\'t fall into any of these categories or some that are 50/50. So when you\'re thinking about a vibe, here are some descriptions and attributes we use to define and assign them. We hope this helps.

    'party' => '''
        Party is pretty straightforward, because most of us have been to a party (or have been partying for quite some time). But assuming makes an ass out of you and me, so here goes an explaination...

        Think Friday or Saturday night clubs. You\'re getting ready to dance the night away, you\'re probably looking good and dressed up for the occasion, made some effort. Slapped on some make-up, shaved. You\'re in the mood to let your hair down a little, to have a drink or two, to let loose.
        
        Well, that\'s sort of what Party Vibe brings. Bear in mind, not everyone can salsa spin with a few gin&tonics in them. So the drinking is optional, but you’ll most likely find a bar with a good selection of booze or cocktails. The overall vibe is where one comes to dance the night away, mingle, and be consumed by the music. The general feel is similar to that of a weekend club– smoke machine and party lights included.
        
        What makes this different than a typical club? The music is very specific and everyone around will most likely be going impressive turns, spins, footwork and sensual body rolls. It\'s a night out on the town, but filled with enthusiastic dancers and all your favorities including salsa, bachata, kizomba, and zouk.
        
        The chosen venue for a party vibe is a bar or restaurant, so floor quality is a bit of a toss-up. In terms of footwear, wear heels at your own risk…

    'practice_plus' => '''
        The origin of Latin dance socials: the PracticePLUS vibe. As we all know, Latin dances are partner dances. You can try to dance salsa or bachata on your own, but it’s not nearly as fun as dancing in a pair. In order to get students to practice what they learned in class in a unintimidating environment, dance academies all over the world have held and promoted what they call “Practices”. There are evenings when sutdios open their doors for their students to go over what they\'ve been taught.

        This is still something that a lot of academies do, but they add a little flair, an extra touch that sets the mood – the right lighting and sound set-up can do wonders to transform a dance academy into a dance floor. That’s why we’ve called it PracticePLUS.
        
        PracticePLUS vibes are usually in a dance academy venue. Here you\'ll usually find a good hardwood floor to dance the night away. It’s actually the perfect opportunity to take your precious dance shoes out for the night without trashing them in the process.
        
        Mirrors are often present, which means you can see if that sexy bachata body roll you’ve been working on looks as smooth as it does in your head, or if your salsa arms are dangerously close to T-rex territory and need to be worked on a little.
        
        Similar to Outdoor socials, you’ll often find dance partners discussing technique, going over moves or explaining new figures or footwork. It helps that the dance floor is never as crowded as one might find at a Party vibe, because there’s plenty of space to try some of the riskier choreos.

    'outdoor' => '''
        Outdoor vibes can be more location or season specific, as they rely heavily on the weather. Medellín\'s eternal-spring-like climate, for example, is perfect for organizing dance events that step out of the four walls of a dance academy or club.

        Because dancing isn\'t restricted to indoor spaces, Outdoor Vibes are for those events or gatherings where people come together in parks, squares, or anywhere that isn\'t enclosed to get their dance on while in the fresh air.
        
        These types of events take place during the day or early evening. It\'s laid back and casual, much like a picnic or local meetup. You can bring your pets and snacks to hangout and make a day out of it.
        
        Of course, everyone is here to dance. So the picnic is complete with speakers blasting some Latin rhythms and dancers pairing up to enjoy their favorite hobby– DANCE!
        
        These types of outdoor dance socials are great to practice and drill in some technique. It\'s socially acceptable to stop mid-song and ask your dance partner to repeat a move or walk you through a particular figure. It\'s also easy to talk, because the music can never be as loud as a club. Conversations during and between dances are commonplace. Needless to say, wardrobe choices are also casual, laidback, and, best of all, fitness-friendly.
