            People would call us dance-obsessed, but we prefer to say we know what we love to do.

            Our friendship came to be through our love of dance. A friend of ours said, "Hey, you both like salsa. You should meet." And just like that, we moved to Medellin, Colombia for a year to pursue our love of dance. After about a year in the City of Eternal Spring, we discovered a vibrant dance community full of incredible talent.
            
            Not only are the dancers talented, but unbelievably warm and welcoming. We were greeted with arms wide open and made to feel like part of a family.
            
            Needless to say, we fell in love and finally understood the POWER OF DANCE.
